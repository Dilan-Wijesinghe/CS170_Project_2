# Feature Selection with Nearest Neighbor

#### Introduction
This Project asks us to implement the Nearest Neighbor Classification, utilizing Forward Selection and Backward Selection to search through relevant features,
and Leave One Out Cross Validation to measure the accuracy of each feature. It is the Second Project given to us by Dr. Keogh at the University of California Riverside,
in his *Introduction to Artificial Intelligence* class. 

#### Folders
Each Folder contains relevant information to the project. The *Images* folder contains several Bar Graphs that compare each dataset and search algorithm.
The *Previous Versions* folder contains text files of past implementations, marked by their date. The *Sample Datasets* are datasets given to us by Dr. Keogh for testing purposes.
Finally the *Results* folder contains the output redirected trace.
